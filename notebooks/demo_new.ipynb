    "# NARDINI Online Fasta Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool, developed by Cohan et al., conducts statistical analysis of **amino acid patterning** within intrisically disordered regions (**IDRs**).\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs and outputs are the same as command-line NARDINI. The input is a **.fasta** file of IDRs; the output is a **.zip** containing **.tsv** and **.png** files.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook sends the FASTA to be processed to an external server, where NARDINI statistical analysis is performed. **You can close this notebook and the analysis will still run, and then come back and get your results.**\n"

    "# Usage Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "1. **Install requirements**: Make sure you have the `requests` library installed:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install requests ipykernel\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prepare your FASTA file**: Place your FASTA file in one of these locations:\n",
    "   - Current directory (same as this notebook)\n",
    "   - `data/fasta_inputs/` folder\n",
    "   - Or specify a custom path\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run the cells in order**: Execute each cell from top to bottom\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "1. **Setup** - Install dependencies and configure environment\n",
    "2. **Test Connection** - Verify backend service is available\n",
    "3. **Select FASTA** - Choose your input file\n",
    "4. **Run Analysis** - Submit file for processing (get Run ID)\n",
    "5. **Check Progress** - Monitor analysis status\n",
    "6. **Download Results** - Get your results when complete\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "Results will be saved to `data/zip_outputs/` folder containing:\n",
    "- A zip file with your analysis results\n",
    "- Run information text files for reference\n"
